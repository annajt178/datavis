# data

Any data pushed to this repo can now be accessed via a URL. For example, if your
GitHub username is myUsername , your repo is called data , and you have a data
file called results.csv, its URL would be
https://myUsername.github.io/data/results.csv . In your visualization
specification you can now reference the data with:
data = dataFromUrl https://myUsername.github.io/data/results.csv" []
